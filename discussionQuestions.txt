Samples question

1)
should the sample registration record have a different identifier than the sample.
i.e. use dct:identifier for the IGSN or other sample URI; 
use sdo:about as explicit statement that the record is about a physical thing with ID
name the sample metadata record PhysicalSampleMetadata instead of PhysicalSample

2)
representation of parent-child links
isam:parentSample property in isam:PhysicalSample
sosa:isResultOf/sosa:featureOfInterest  link through the target of the sampling event for the child
Sampling Relation with relationship type encapsulating the derivationprocess (split, subset...)

3)
scoped name pattern for Type properties

4)
how to deal with status
-- scoped name, only one
-- event with date, e.g. registered, lost, embargo until, made public, consumed/destroyed, moved to new location, metadata update.  Could have sequence of events.

5)
what is mandatory on samplingEvent?

6)
are boreholes or other sampling features in scope?
