Samples question

1)
should the sample registration record have a different identifier than the sample.
i.e. use dct:identifier for the IGSN or other sample URI; 
use sdo:about as explicit statement that the record is about a physical thing with ID
name the sample metadata record PhysicalSampleMetadata instead of PhysicalSample

2)
representation of parent-child links
isam:parentSample property in isam:PhysicalSample
sosa:isResultOf/sosa:featureOfInterest  link through the target of the sampling event for the child
Sampling Relation with relationship type encapsulating the derivationprocess (split, subset...)

3)
scoped name pattern for Type properties

4)
how to deal with status
-- scoped name, only one
-- event with date, e.g. registered, lost, embargo until, made public, consumed/destroyed, moved to new location, metadata update.  Could have sequence of events.

5)
what is mandatory on samplingEvent?

6)
are boreholes or other sampling features in scope?

7)
what kind of specimen is a 'peel' or 'cast'.  Example I could find suggests it is obtained by putting latex or something on a surface, and peeling it off to obtain a cast impression of the surface.

8)
'pharmaceutical specimen' -- what? organic material? 

9) 
egg-- whole organism?, material-- the shell is not organic material. Eggs in collection must either be preserved in some fluid, or 'Blown eggshell'.

10)
SEM stub-- like a microscope slide but prepared for Scanning Electron Microscope
need specimen type for 'mounted processed specimen'



Material type problems:
cuttings, dredge haul -- aggregate-- might include soil, sediment, rock.  
core-- could be rock or sediment
melt inclusion?
rock powder
synthetic rock or mineral material-- particulate, rock or mineral
loss on ignition ash.  4 thought it was organic
biogenic mineral material-- shell, coral, bone?, teeth. Not organic (according to definition), not rock....
Dispersed media definition needs clarification
polished thin section, xrf bead, thin section, synthetic powders-- distinguish modern artifact from historic artifact???
