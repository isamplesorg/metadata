### Fossil
Specimen is fossilized remains of one or more organism preserved in rock; includes whole body, body parts (usually bone or shell), and trace fossils. Fossilization implies replacement of material by new phases, along with loss of most organic material. Note these will overlap with ‘piece of solid material’ or Aggregation (if a collection of fossils from a single source)

### Whole organism
Specimen consists of the bodies of one or more entire organisms of the same species, from any kingdom. e.g. Bird, snake, fish etc, typically preserved in some fluid in a container; pin-mounted insect; whole plant on herbarium sheet. 

### Biome aggregation
Specimen is an aggregation of whole or fragmentary parts of multiple organisms representative of some site. E.g.: Leaf litter, soil, water, or sediment collected for biological analysis, ocean trawl for biome sample.  Cultures derived from a soil or water sample. 

### Organism part
Part of an organism, e.g. a tissue sample, plant leaf, flower, bird feather, bone, shell or other internal hard body part (not fossilized).  Does not necessarily imply existance of parent sample. Not fossilized; generally includes organism parts native to deposits of Holocene to Recent age. Tissue, chitin, teeth, claws, bone, horn (with organic tissue included); Herbarium packet with plant parts.

### Organism product
Shell, antler, coral skeleton (organic tissue not included), fecal matter, nest. 

### Artifact
An object made (manufactured, shaped, modified) by a human being, or precursor hominid. Include a set of pieces belonging originally to a single object and treated as a single specimen. The object is composed of material made by human activity (e.g. glass, plaster, refined metal), or is natural material shaped/modified by human activity (e.g. bricks, carved bone, sculpture, textiles…)

### Other solid object
Single piece of material not one of the other types, e.g. rock specimen, mineral specimen, core. Ice and permafrost are considered solid materials. Includes set of pieces belonging originally to a single object and treated as a single specimen. E.g.: Cores of rock, sediment or soil that are curated as objects; rock or mineral samples; meteorites. Objects produced by living organism should be classified as organism product.

### Liquid or Gas sample
Liquid, gas, or mixed dominantly fluid phases; boundary constraint on what makes something part of the sample is the container that it is in.  Includes colloids, foams, gels, suspensions. The sampled feature is the fluid substance; fluid samples collected to analyze the contained biome should be considered *Biome Aggregation*

### Aggregation
Sample consists of a bunch of material fragments, not related to the same object (e.g. not a bunch of broken pot sherds that might be reassembled), but taken together representative of the sampled feature. Examples: soil, sediment, crushed rock,  particulate, including (non-biological) filtrates and residues. The sample requires some kind of container to keep it together. Cores of loosely consolidated material are considered 'piece of solid material' because the internal parts have spatial relationships (e.g. upper part, lower part).

### Anthropogenic aggregation
Building rubble, pot sherd collection, slag, miscellaneous waste material. The individual particles or objects are made by humans.

### Analytical preparation
Sample is material that has been modified by mixing, grinding, chemical changes etc. to prepare for analysis in some procedure. e.g. thin section, XRF bead, SEM stub, rock powder. If identified separately, this should have a ‘parent’ link to the original sample

### Experimental product
Sample is product of an experimental procedure (e.g. synthetic material)
