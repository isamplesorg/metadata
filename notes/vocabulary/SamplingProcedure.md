# Sample procedure

Draft vocabualry for sampling procedure categories used to differentiate specimen types.  This is not intended to be an exhaustive vocabulary for the entire universe of sampling procedures, only those that based on our compilation of specimen descriptions are used to classify specimen types.  

The compilation so far indicates that there are two broad groups of procedures mentioned. 'In Situ' procedures are those executed as a specimen is being collected from its original context.  'Laboratory' procedures are executed after the specimen is obtained and brought into the analysis environment. 

Procedures broadly fall into mechanical processes that do not change the chemistry of the specimen, and chemical processes that involve chemical reactions with one or more phases in the specimen. 

Some processes result in splitting or subsetting a parent specimen to produce 'child' specimens.  Splitting produces child specimens that are still representative of the original sampled feature, ideally separating the parent specimen into equivalent, but smaller, parts.  Subsetting results in child samples that represent specific components of the original sample, either by mechanical separation processes or chemical concentration processes.  Subsetting processes commonly produce a 'residue' that consists of the remainder material not included in the desired subset part.

## Need clarification
**chamber or core incubation**
**automated method**
**genome isolation** isolate genomic DNA away from proteins, RNA and other cellular material

## 1. analytic extraction
Sample is defined during analysis, generally microscopic point analyses

### 1.1 heating by laser, electron or energized ion beam
The sample is a 'spot' within a parent sample, defined by where the energy beam is aimed during an analysis process.

## 2. mechanical preparation
Procedures that modify the sample mechanically without changing its chemical composition. Some mechanical refinement process involve concentrating particular phases in the sample using physical properties, particularly  density or magnetic susceptibility.

## 4. In Situ sampling method
**down hole formation test** method in which a section of a borehole is isolated to extract fluid from a specific wall rock interval.
**dredging** method in which a basket is dragged along the bottom of a water body to gather samples
**drilling** method in which a hole is manufactured in rock, ice or sediment to extract material from the subsurface
**dry deposition** in Petri dish. method in which particulate matter is collected by density settling from the atmosphere (???)
**fragmentation** Method in which bit of rock are broken off along a trench or outcrops in a limited area to obtain a representative sample. 
**box core** marine geological sampling tool for soft sediments in lakes or oceans. Deployed by dropping from a research vessel with a wire, designed for a minimum of disturbance of the sediment surface by bow wave effects which is important for quantitative investigations of the benthic micro- to macrofauna, geochemical processes, sampling of bottom water or sedimentology.

**raking** Sample obtained by scraping material from the surface with a rake
**remove body part** Sample obtained by removing a part of a plant or animal
**swabbing** Sample obtained by rubbing a sampled feature with an absorbent pad or piece of material.
**trawling**
**geospatial orientation**
