# Sampled feature

See [decision tree](https://github.com/isamplesorg/metadata/blob/main/vocabulary/SampledFeatureDecisionTree.pdf) (simplified somewhat from this intitial version) and [OWL (rdf/turtle) draft](https://github.com/isamplesorg/metadata/blob/main/vocabulary/iSample-SampledFeature.ttl)
								
**Any** Specimen type is not specific to a kind of sampled feature
**Biological environment** specimen samples an ecosystem, focused on the biological organisms in that system
 - **Marine Biome** Sampled feature is the biological system within or directly interacting with a marine water body.
 - **Subaqueous terrrestrial biome** Sampled feature is the biological system on or adjacent to the Earth surface exposed to a non-marine water body			
 - **Subaerial terrestrial biome** Sampled feature is the biological system on or adjacent to the Earth surface exposed to the atmosphere 	

**Extraterrestrial environment** Sample represents material that did not originate on Earth

**Earth environment** specimen samples the natural earth environment. Sample is not specifically focused on biological or ecological properties of the sampled feature

 - **Atmosphere** specimen samples the earth atmosphere
 - **Glacier environment** Sample of ice or water from a glacier, ice sheet, ice shelf, iceberg. Does not include various environments adjacent to glacier.

 - **Earth Surface** Samples things at boundary between solid earth and hydrosphere or atmosphere; Includes samples representing things collected on the surface.

   - **Subaerial surface environment** Sample is collected on the surface (e.g. leaf litter), or immediately below surface (zone of bioturbation). Include soil profile, regolith, and ‘biomantle’

   - **Lake, river or stream bottom** Active sediment from stream bed should be included in ‘Regolith, sediment or soil horizon’

   - **Marine water body bottom** Things collected on the surface at the bottom of a water body, e.g. dredge haul, manganese nodules. Includes benthic zone, 

  - **Water body** specimen samples the hydrosphere
   - **Marine water body** Include brackish and hypersaline water bodies in marine borderland wetlands, estuaries, coastal sabka.

   - **Terrrestrial water body** Sampled feature is river, stream, lake, salt lake; water from springs that has been resident on the Earth Surface long enough to equilibrate is considered 'terrestrial' as opposed to subsurface fluid; the distinction is subjective and not clear cut.
   
 - **Subsurface fluid reservoir** Feature of interest is the liquid or gas contained in a subsurface reservoir, e.g. oil, natural gas, CO2, water, including liquids or gas from hydrothermal vents or hot springs. 

 - **Earth interior** Specimen samples rock, sediment, or mineral that is within the Earth, below the zone of direct interaction with the atmosphere or hydrosphere

**Human occupation site** specimen samples materials or objects produced by human activity
 - **Experimental setting**  Specimen is sample of experimental product
 - **Lab environment** specimen samples the environment in a laboratory
 - **Active human occupation site**  A place where humans are currently living or otherwise directly affecting the environment, e.g. farms, mines, waste disposal sites. 

 - **Historic human occupation site**  A place where humans have been and left evidence of their activity; includes prehistoric sites and hominid sites.
