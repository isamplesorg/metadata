### Fossil
Specimen is fossilized remains of one or more organism preserved in rock; includes whole body, body parts (usually bone or shell), and trace fossils. 
### Whole organism
Specimen consists of the bodies of one or more entire organisms of the same species, from any kingdom.
### Biome aggregation
Specimen is an aggregation of whole or fragmentary parts of multiple organisms representative of some site.
### Organism part
Part of an organism, e.g. a tissue sample, plant leaf, flower, bird feather, bone, shell or other hard body part (not fossilized).  Does not necessarily imply existance of parent sample. Not fossilized; generally includes organism parts native to deposits of Holocene to Recent age.
### Artifact
An object made (manufactured, shaped, modified) by a human being, or precursor hominid. Include a set of pieces belonging originally to a single object and treated as a single specimen.
### Piece of solid material
Single piece of material not one of the other types, e.g. rock specimen, mineral specimen, core. Ice and permafrost are considered solid materials. Includes set of pieces belonging originally to a single object and treated as a single specimen.
### Container with fluid
Liquid, gas, or mixed dominantly fluid phases in a container.  Includes colloids, foams, gels, suspensions. The sampled feature is the fluid substance; fluid samples collected to analyze the contained biome should be considered *Biome Aggregation*
### Aggregation
Sample consists of a bunch of material fragments, not related to the same object (e.g. not a bunch of broken pot sherds that might be reassembled), but taken together representative of the sampled feature. Examples: soil, sediment, crushed rock,  particulate, including (non-biological) filtrates and residues. The sample requires some kind of container to keep it together. Cores of loosely consolidated material are considered 'piece of solid material' because the internal parts have spatial relationships (e.g. upper part, lower part).
