# Natural solid
### Rock
Consolidated aggregate of particles (grains) of rock, mineral (including native elements), mineraloid, or solid organic material. Includes mineral aggregates such as granite, shale, marble; natural glass such as obsidian;  organic material formed by geologic processes such a coal; and extraterrestrial material in meteorites. (based on http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/lithology/rock, same as http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_00001995)
### Mineral
"A mineral is an element or chemical compound that is normally crystalline and that has been formed as a result of geological processes." (Nickel, Ernest H. (1995), The definition of a mineral,  The Canadian Mineralogist. 33 (3): 689â€“90). Include mineraloids. ... A  material  primarily composed of some substance that is naturally occurring, solid and stable at room temperature, representable by a chemical formula, usually abiogenic, and that has an ordered atomic structure. (http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01000256).   Comment: the identity of a mineral species is defined by a crystal structure and a chemical composition that might include various specific elemental substitutions in that structure.  Mineraloid:  A naturally occurring mineral-like substance that does not demonstrate crystallinity. Mineraloids possess chemical compositions that vary beyond the generally accepted ranges for specific minerals. Examples: obsidian, Opal. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineraloid)
### Soil
"mixed mineral and organic matter modified by interaction between earth material, biosphere, and atmosphere.  Soil is an environmental material which is primarily composed of minerals, varying proportions of sand, silt, and clay, organic material such as humus, gases, liquids, and a broad range of resident micro- and macroorganisms. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil)
Soil consists of horizons near the Earth's surface that, in contrast to the underlying parent material, have been altered by the interactions of climate, relief, and living organisms over time. (http://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/soils/edu/?cid=nrcs142p2_054280) (http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_00001998)"
### Sediment
Solid granular material transported by wind, water, or gravity, not modified by interaction with biosphere or atmosphere (to differentiate from soil).  Particles derived by erosion of pre-existing rock, from shell or other body parts from organisms, or precipitated chemically in the surficial environment (http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/lithology/sediment). Sediment is not consolidated, i.e. Particulate constituents of a compound material do not adhere to each other strongly enough that the aggregate can be considered a solid material in its own right.(http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/consolidationdegree/consolidated).  Similar to http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_00002007
### Particulate
Material consists of microscopic particulate material derived by precipitation, filtering, or settling from suspension in a fluid.  particulates, e.g. filtrate from water, deposition from atmosphere, astro material particles. Might include mineral, organic, or biological material. ENVO definition (ENVO_01000060) has "composed of microscopic portions of solid or liquid material suspended in another environmental material.", refine here to define as the solid particles, distinct from a material in which they are suspended. A material that includes solid or liquid particles suspended in another material would be a dispersed_media in this scheme, not defined in ENVO.

# Fluids
### Water
Sample is water or an aqueous solution; infer that the sample is curated in some kind of container
### Gas
Material composed of one or more chemical entities that has neither independent shape nor volume but tends to expand indefinitely (http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01000797). Infer that the sample is curated in some kind of container
### Other liquid
liquids that do not fit other category. E.g. alcohol  [?this is an edge case, do we need it?]

# Anthropogenic material
Material produced by human activity.  Organic products of agricultural activity are both anthropogenic and organic.  Examples: ceramics, concrete, slag, (anthropogenic) glass, mine tailing, plaster, waste.  (http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_0010001)
### Anthropogenic metal
Metallic material that has been produced or used by humans; subclass of anthropogenic material.  Samples of naturally occuring metallic material (e.g. native copper, gold nuggets) should be considered mineral material.  Metallic material is material that when polished or fractured, shows a lustrous appearance, and conducts electricity and heat relatively well. Metals are typically malleable (they can be hammered into thin sheets) or ductile (can be drawn into wires).  The boundaries between metals, nonmetals, and metalloids fluctuate slightly due to a lack of universally accepted definitions of the categories involved.  (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal). c.f. http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01001069

# Carbon-rich
### Hydrocarbon material
http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_2000045 (no definition in ENVO). Examples: kerogen, natural gas, biogas, methane ice, petroleum, gasoline, fuel oil, asphalt). To distinguish from biological material need clear criteria on when a 'very large molecule of biological origin' becomes a hydrocarbon chain.  
### Organic Material
Environmental material derived from living organisms and composed primarily of one or more very large molecules of biological origin. Examples: body (animal or plant), body part, fecal matter, seeds, wood, tissue, biological fluids, biological waste, algal material, biofilm, necromass, plankton).  http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01000155


# Dispersed media
A material that consists of two media that do not mix. More specifically, it contains discrete elements of one medium which are dispersed in a continuous second medium. The two media can be of very different nature. In particular, they can be a gas, a liquid or a solid. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispersed_media). Examples: aerosol ENVO_00010505, foam ENVO_00005738, emulsion ENVO_00010506, colloidal suspension ENVO_01001560, scum(?)ENVO:00003930, permafrost? clathrate?
