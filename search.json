(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sponge)\n\n\n\nFungi\n\nConcept: Fungi\nChild of: eukaryote\neukaryotic organisms that contain chitin in their cell walls, are heterotrophs (they obtain their nutrients by absorbing organic material from their environment, either as decomposers, parasites, or symbionts) , lack chloroplasts, reproduce both sexually and asexually, and can take on a variety of growth forms, including single-celled yeasts, multicellular molds, and complex, specialized fruiting bodies. (ChatGPT)\n\nMacrofungi\n\nConcept: macrofungi\nChild of: Fungi\nMacrofungi refers to all fungi that produce visible fruiting bodies. These fungi are evolutionarily and ecologically very divergent. Evolutionarily, they belong to two main phyla, Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, and many of them have relatives that cannot form visible fruiting bodies.(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6106070/)\n\n\nMicrofungi\n\nConcept: microfungi\nChild of: Fungi\nMicrofungi or micromycetes are fungi—eukaryotic organisms such as molds, mildews and rusts—which have microscopic spore-producing structures. They exhibit tube tip-growth and have cell walls composed of chitin, a polymer of N-acetylglucosamine. Microfungi are a paraphyletic group, distinguished from macrofungi only by the absence of a large, multicellular fruiting body. Include moulds, yeasts. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microfungi)\n\n\n\nPlantae\n\nConcept: Plantae\nChild of: eukaryote\nPlants are eukaryotes that have cell walls made of cellulose, specialized organelles called chloroplasts, which contain chlorophyll and other pigments that allow plants to perform photosynthesis and produce their own food; a unique life cycle that involves alternating between a haploid gametophyte stage and a diploid sporophyte stage; specialized regions called apical meristems at the tips of their roots and shoots, which allow for growth and the development of new tissues; specialized structures for reproduction, including flowers, cones, and spores, and most plants have specialized tissues called xylem and phloem, which transport water, nutrients, and other substances throughout the plant.

Spermatophytes are a subset of the embryophytes or land plants. They include most familiar types of plants, including all flowers and most trees, but exclude some other types of plants such as ferns, mosses, algae. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spermatophyte). Includes Gymnosperms (naked-seed plants) and Angiosperms (flowering plants).\n\n\n\nProtista\n\nConcept: Protista\nChild of: eukaryote\nany organism whose cells contain a cell nucleus (a eucaryote) that is not an animal, plant, or fungus. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protist). Protista is not a specific taxonomic group, but a term that historically referred to a group of eukaryotic organisms that did not fit into the other kingdoms of plants, animals, and fungi. (ChatGPT)\n\nAmoebozoa\n\nConcept: amoebozoa\nChild of: Protista\na diverse group of organisms that share certain characteristics, such as the ability to move using pseudopodia, temporary extensions of the cell membrane and cytoplasm that allow the cell to crawl or engulf food particles, the lack of rigid cell walls, presence of mitochondria, which are organelles that generate energy for the cell through cellular respiration (chatGPT)\n\nMyxomycetes\n\nConcept: myxomycete\nChild of: amoebozoa\nAclass of slime molds. All species pass through several, very different morphologic phases, such as microscopic individual cells, slimy amorphous organisms visible with the naked eye and conspicuously shaped fruit bodies. Although they are monocellular, they can reach immense widths and weights. Some consider the Myxomycota to be a separate kingdom, with an unsettled phylogeny because of conflicting molecular and developmental data. The relations among Myxogastrid orders are as yet unclear. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycetozoa). Mycetozoa includes the slime molds, which are a group of organisms that have both amoeboid and fungal-like characteristics. The Mycetozoa can be further subdivided into two groups: the plasmodial slime molds and the cellular slime molds. Myxomycetes are unique among the Amoebozoa in that they have a complex life cycle involving the formation of spore-bearing structures called fruiting bodies, which is a key feature that distinguishes them from other amoebae. (ChatGPT)\n\n\n\nProtozoa\n\nConcept: protozoa\nChild of: Protista\nA single-celled eukaryote, either free-living or parasitic, that feed on organic matter such as other microorganisms or organic tissues and debris. Historically, protozoans were regarded as ‘one-celled animals’, because they often possess animal-like behaviours, such as motility and predation, and lack a cell wall, as found in plants and many algae. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protozoa)\n\n\n\nAlgae\n\nConcept: algae\nChild of: eukaryote\ninformal term for a large and diverse group of photosynthetic eukaryotic organisms. Included organisms range from unicellular microalgae, such as Chlorella, Prototheca and the diatoms, to multicellular forms, such as the giant kelp, a large brown alga which may grow up to 50 metres (160 ft) in length. Most are aquatic and autotrophic (they generate food internally) and lack many of the distinct cell and tissue types, such as stomata, xylem and phloem that are found in land plants. Includes red algae (Rhodophycophyta), brown algae (Phaeophycophyta), and green algae (Chlorophycophyta). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algae\n\n\nEukaryotic microorganisms\n\nConcept: eukaryoticmicroorganisms\nChild of: eukaryote\nEukaryote single-cell organisms that does not fit in one of the other classes.\n\n\n\nLichen\n\nConcept: lichen\nChild of: biologicalentity\nA composite organism that arises from algae or cyanobacteria living among filaments of multiple fungi species in a mutualistic relationship. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lichen). Lichens are not classified under a specific kingdom as they are a symbiotic association between a fungus and either an alga or a cyanobacterium. The fungal partner belongs to the kingdom Fungi, while the algal or cyanobacterial partner belongs to either the kingdom Plantae or the kingdom Bacteria, respectively. (ChatGPT)\n\n\nPlasmid\n\nConcept: plasmid\nChild of: biologicalentity\nA plasmid is a small, extrachromosomal DNA molecule within a cell that is physically separated from chromosomal DNA and can replicate independently. While chromosomes are large and contain all the essential genetic information for living under normal conditions, plasmids are usually very small and contain only additional genes that may be useful in certain situations or conditions. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmid)\n\n\nProkaryote\n\nConcept: prokaryote\nChild of: biologicalentity\nsingle-celled organisms that lack a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles. Unlike cells of animals and other eukaryotes, bacterial cells do not contain a nucleus and rarely harbour membrane-bound organelles. Molecular systematics showed prokaryotic life to consist of two separate domains, originally called Eubacteria and Archaebacteria, but now called Bacteria and Archaea that evolved independently from an ancient common ancestor. Almost all prokaryotes have a cell wall, a protective structure that allows them to survive in extreme conditions, which is located outside of their plasma membrane. Archaea and bacteria cannot reproduce sexually.\n\nArchaea\n\nConcept: archaea\nChild of: prokaryote\narchaeal cell walls are composed of polysaccharides (sugars). they never have peptidoglycan in their cell walls, their cell membranes contain lipids of unique composition (glycerol molecules are mirror images of those found in other cells, and form ether linkages to isoprenoid side chains), and their 16S ribosomal- RNA nucleotide sequences are unlike those of bacteria. (https://quizlet.com/234154298/archaea-and-bacteria-flash-cards/). The common characteristics of Archaebacteria known to date are these: (1) the presence of characteristic tRNAs and ribosomal RNAs; (2) the absence of peptidoglycan cell walls, with in many cases, replacement by a largely proteinaceous coat; (3) the occurrence of ether linked lipids built from phytanyl chains and (4) in all cases known so far, their occurrence only in unusual habitats. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/691075/)\n\n\nBacteria\n\nConcept: bacteria\nChild of: prokaryote\na large domain of prokaryotic microorganisms. Bacterial cells do not contain a nucleus and rarely harbour membrane-bound organelles. The bacterial cell is surrounded by a cell membrane, which is made primarily of phospholipids. This membrane encloses the contents of the cell and acts as a barrier to hold nutrients, proteins and other essential components of the cytoplasm within the cell. Bacterial cell walls are composed of peptidoglycan, a complex of protein and sugars, while archaeal cell walls are composed of polysaccharides (sugars). (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria)\n\n\n\nVirus\n\nConcept: virus\nChild of: biologicalentity\nA virus is a submicroscopic infectious agent that replicates only inside the living cells of an organism. Realms are Adnaviria, Duplodnaviria, Monodnaviria, Riboviria, Ribozyviria, Varidnaviria (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus).

(https://bio.libretext s.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/Book)\n\nOther Virus\n\nConcept: othervirus\nChild of: virus\nVirus that is not a member of order Caudovirales (e.g., bacteriophage T4, lambda phage).\n\n\nPhage\n\nConcept: phage\nChild of: virus\nA bacteriophage, also known informally as a phage, is a duplodnaviria virus that infects and replicates within bacteria and archaea. Bacteriophages are composed of proteins that encapsulate a DNA or RNA genome, and may have structures that are either simple or elaborate. Their genomes may encode as few as four genes (e.g. MS2) and as many as hundreds of genes. Phages replicate within the bacterium following the injection of their genome into its cytoplasm. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteriophage). Includes all virus in order Caudovirales (e.g., bacteriophage T4, lambda phage).\n\n\n\n\nEarth environment\n\nConcept: earthenvironment\nChild of: anysampledfeature\nspecimen samples the natural earth environment\nSee Also:\n\n&lt;http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/MESH/D004777&gt;\n&lt;http://semanticscience.org/resource/SIO_000955&gt;\n\n\nAtmosphere\n\nConcept: atmosphere\nChild of: earthenvironment\nspecimen samples the Earth’s atmosphere\nSee Also:\n\n&lt;http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01000267&gt;\n&lt;http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RBO_00000018&gt;\n\n\n\nEarth interior\n\nConcept: earthinterior\nChild of: earthenvironment\nSpecimen samples solid material within the earth (fluids in pore space in earth interior sample ‘subsurface fluid reservoir’\n\n\nEarth surface\n\nConcept: earthsurface\nChild of: earthenvironment\nSpecimen samples the interface between solid earth and hydrosphere or atmosphere.

For example changes take place in organic materials at lower temperatures than in rocks dominated by silicate minerals. In mudrocks, a white mica (illite) crystallinity value of less than 0.42 Delta 2 Theta obtained by X-ray diffraction analysis, is used to define the onset of metamorphism (Kisch, 1991). In this scheme, the first appearance of glaucophane, lawsonite, paragonite, prehnite, pumpellyite or stilpnomelane is taken to indicate the lower limit of metamorphism (Frey and Kisch, 1987; Bucher and Frey, 1994; Frey and Robinson, 1998). Most workers agree that such mineral growth starts at 150 +/- 50° C in silicate rocks. Many lithologies may show no change in mineralogy under these conditions and hence the recognition of the onset of metamorphism will vary with bulk composition.” Rock formed by solid-state mineralogical, chemical and/or structural changes to a pre-existing rock, in response to marked changes in temperature, pressure, shearing stress and chemical environment.\n\n\nhttps://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/rocksediment/0.9/Metasomatic_Rock\n\nConcept: Metasomatic_Rock\nChild of: rock\nRock that has fabric and composition indicating open-system mineralogical and chemical changes in response to interaction with a fluid phase, typically water rich. SLTTm (2004) proposed the following criteria to distinguish hydrothermally altered or metasomatic rock from igneous rock. “The rock is classified as metamorphic if (1) the texture has been modified such that it can no longer be considered igneous, (2) the bulk composition of the rock is inconsistent with compositions that can be derived purely from a magma and associated processes such as assimilation and differentiation, or (3) minerals inconsistent with magmatic crystallization are present.”\n\n\nhttps://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/rocksediment/0.9/Sedimentary_Rock\n\nConcept: Sedimentary_Rock\nChild of: rock\nRock formed by accumulation and cementation of solid fragmental material deposited by air, water or ice, or as a result of other natural agents, such as precipitation from solution, the accumulation of organic material, or from biogenic processes, including secretion by organisms. Includes epiclastic deposits.\n\nhttps://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/rocksediment/0.9/Carbonate_Sedimentary_Rock\n\nConcept: Carbonate_Sedimentary_Rock\nChild of: Sedimentary_Rock\nParticularly for fine-grained sedimentary rocks, distinction of ‘intrabasinal’ versus ‘clastic’ genesis can be very interpretive. In practice the use of clastic mudstone terminology as opposed to carbonate mudstone terminology may be dermined by a priori knowledge about the rock being categorized. If it is associated with other clastic rocks, the clastic categories will be favored, if with cabonate rocks, the carbonate categories will be favored. Carbonate rock subcatgories are defined on two orthogonal dimensions–mineralogy (calcitic vs. dolomitic vs non-carbonate impurities), and texture. The texture categories used here are those of Dunham (1962), and involve grain size (matrix vs. grains/allochems), fabric (matrix vs. grain supported), and genesis (bound, frame, or fragmental). The textural approach used for carbonate rocks is conceptually incompatible with that used for clastic sedimentary rocks, which is solely grain size or mineralogy based. This leads to problems in the vocabulary for rocks of mixed siliclastic/carbonate mineralogy (grainstone vs. sandstone, carbonate mudstone vs. carbonate rich mudstone, how to accomodate marlstone…). Sedimentary rock in which at least 50 percent of the primary and/or recrystallized constituents are composed of one (or more) of the carbonate minerals calcite, aragonite, magnesite or dolomite.\n\n\nhttps://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/rocksediment/0.9/Clastic_Sedimentary_Rock\n\nConcept: Clastic_Sedimentary_Rock\nChild of: Sedimentary_Rock\nSedimentary rock in which at least 50 percent of the constituent particles were derived from erosion, weathering, or mass-wasting of pre-existing earth materials, and transported to the place of deposition by mechanical agents such as water, wind, ice and gravity. The conglomerate, sandstone, mudstone, and wackestone categories are not defined as kinds of clastic sedimentary rocks because rocks meeting their purely grainsize based definitions might also be iron- rich, phosphatic, or carbonate. This is based on GeoSciML allowance to assign rocks to more than one lithology category. For example to categorize a rock as a clastic conglomerate requires assignment ot the ‘clastic sedimentary rock’ category and to the ‘conglomerate’ category. Particularly for fine-grained sedimentary rocks, distinction of ‘intrabasinal’ versus ‘clastic’ genesis can be very interpretive. In practice the use of clastic mudstone terminology as opposed to carbonate mudstone terminology may be dermined by a priori knowledge about the rock being categorized. If it is associated with other clastic rocks, the clastic categories will be favored, if with cabonate rocks, the carbonate categories will be favored.\n\nhttps://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/rocksediment/0.9/Diamictite\n\nConcept: Diamictite\nChild of: Clastic_Sedimentary_Rock\nUnsorted or poorly sorted, clastic sedimentary rock with a wide range of particle sizes including a muddy matrix. Biogenic materials that have such texture are excluded. Distinguished from conglomerate, sandstone, mudstone based on polymodality and lack of structures related to transport and deposition of sediment by moving air or water. If more than 10 percent of the fine grained matrix is of indeterminant clastic or diagenetic origin and the fabric is matrix supported, may also be categorized as wacke.\n\n\n\nhttps://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/rocksediment/0.9/Generic_Conglomerate\n\nConcept: Generic_Conglomerate\nChild of: Sedimentary_Rock\nSedimentary rock composed of at least 30 percent rounded to subangular fragments larger than 2 mm in diameter; typically contains finer grained material in interstices between larger fragments. If more than 15 percent of the fine grained matrix is of indeterminant clastic or diagenetic origin and the fabric is matrix supported, may also be categorized as wackestone. If rock has unsorted or poorly sorted texture with a wide range of particle sizes, may also be categorized as diamictite.\n\n\nhttps://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/rocksediment/0.9/Generic_Mudstone\n\nConcept: Generic_Mudstone\nChild of: Sedimentary_Rock\nDistinction of intrabasinal, diagenetic, or clastic genesis for very fine-grained carbonate minerals is so interpretive that it is proposed to not define the mudstone category based on intrabasinal vs epiclastic distinction required for clastic sedimentary rock-carbonate sedimentary rock categorization in this system.

Particles derived by erosion of pre-existing rock, from shell or other body parts from organisms, precipitated chemically in the surficial environment, or generated by explosive volcanic activity. (http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/lithology/sediment).

Sediment composed of greater than 50 percent material of biogenic origin.

Other suggested labels for this category include siliciclastic and terrigineous clastic. Siliciclastic is considered too limiting because the category includes rocks that consists clasts of carbonate minerals, e.g. epiclastic detritus eroded from carbonate rock. Terrigineous clastic was considered and rejected first because it is considered redundant, anything that is terrigineous is clastic. Second, it is questionable if clastic sediment derived by submarine processes (fragementation by gravity sliding, faulting, or volcanic activity, with transport by sediment gravity flow or submarine currents) is terrigineous, but it is clastic and is meant to be included in this category. Sediment in which at least 50 percent of the constituent particles were derived from erosion, weathering, or mass-wasting of pre-existing earth materials, and transported to the place of deposition by mechanical agents such as water, wind, ice and gravity.\n\nhttps://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/rocksediment/0.9/Diamicton\n\nConcept: Diamicton\nChild of: Clastic_Sediment\nUnsorted or poorly sorted, clastic sediment with a wide range of particle sizes, including a muddy matrix.

    "text": "Physical specimen\n\nConcept: physicalspecimen\ntop concept in specimen type hierarchy. Represents any physical specimen.\n\nAny aggregation specimen\n\nConcept: anyaggregation\nChild of: physicalspecimen\nSample consists of a bunch of material fragments, not related to the same object (e.g. not a bunch of broken pot sherds that might be reassembled), but taken together representative of the sampled feature. Examples: loose soil, sediment, crushed rock, particulate, bunches of unrelated pot sherd, human production waste, filtrates and residues. The sample requires some kind of container to keep it together. Cores of loosely consolidated material are considered ‘piece of solid material’ because the internal parts have spatial relationships (e.g. upper part, lower part).\n\nAnthropogenic aggregation\n\nConcept: anthropogenicaggregation\nChild of: anyaggregation\nAggregation consists of fragments of material produced by human activity, not described individually, and generally not all originating from the same object. Includes pottery in an excavation unit that gets an aggregate description, production waste, production raw-materials, or other residues (broken bits of plaster from an destroyed wall), synthetic powders.\n\n\nBiome aggregation sample\n\nConcept: biomeaggregation\nChild of: anyaggregation biologicalspecimen\nSpecimen is an aggregation of whole or fragmentary parts of multiple organisms, microscopic or megascopic, representative of some site.\n\nBundle biome aggregation\n\nConcept: bundlebiomeaggregation\nChild of: biomeaggregation\nAn aggregation of whole organisms representative of some biome\n\n\nSlurry biome aggregation\n\nConcept: slurrybiomeaggregation\nChild of: biomeaggregation\na material that consists of mixed organic and inorganic material, including whole organisms and organism fragments.\n\n\n\nAggregation\n\nConcept: genericaggregation\nChild of: anyaggregation\nAn aggregate specimen that is not biogenic or composed of anthropogenic material fragments. Examples: loose soil or sediment (e.g. in a bag), rock chips, particulate filtrate or precipitate; rock powders.\n\n\n\nArtifact\n\nConcept: artifact\nChild of: physicalspecimen\nAn object made (manufactured, shaped, modified) by a human being, or precursor hominid. Include a set of pieces belonging originally to a single object and treated as a single specimen.\n\nArchitectural element\n\nConcept: architecturalelement\nChild of: artifact\nArtifact that was part of a building.\n\n\nClothing\n\nConcept: clothing\nChild of: artifact\nItem intended to be worn to cover the (human) body\n\n\nCoin\n\nConcept: coin\nChild of: artifact\npeice of metal issued by some authority and recognized as money.\n\n\nContainer object\n\nConcept: containerobject\nChild of: artifact\nItem designed to contain some fluid, granular material, or other items for preservation, transportation or display.\n\n\nDomestic item\n\nConcept: domesticitem\nChild of: artifact\nitem intended for household use.\n\n\nOrnament\n\nConcept: ornament\nChild of: artifact\nitem intended for decoration.\n\n\nPhotograph\n\nConcept: photograph\nChild of: artifact\nimage produced by the action of light on a chemically sensitive surface, preserved on paper, glass or other physical substrate.\n\n\nPot sherd\n\nConcept: sherd\nChild of: artifact\nfragment of pottery\n\n\nTile\n\nConcept: tile\nChild of: artifact\nflat or curved piece of fired clay, stone, or concrete used especially for roofs, floors, or walls and often for ornamental work\n\n\nUtility item\n\nConcept: utilityitem\nChild of: artifact\nItem intended for use in manufacture, construction, agriculture or other work activity.\n\n\nWeapon\n\nConcept: weapon\nChild of: artifact\nItem for use in combat, hunting, or self defense\n\n\n\nAny biological specimen\n\nConcept: biologicalspecimen\nChild of: physicalspecimen\nSpecimen for which the sampled feature is one or more living organisms from a particular biome context, megascopic or microscopic\n\nBiome aggregation sample\n\nConcept: biomeaggregation\nChild of: anyaggregation biologicalspecimen\nSpecimen is an aggregation of whole or fragmentary parts of multiple organisms, microscopic or megascopic, representative of some site.\n\nBundle biome aggregation\n\nConcept: bundlebiomeaggregation\nChild of: biomeaggregation\nAn aggregation of whole organisms representative of some biome\n\n\nSlurry biome aggregation\n\nConcept: slurrybiomeaggregation\nChild of: biomeaggregation\na material that consists of mixed organic and inorganic material, including whole organisms and organism fragments.\n\n\n\nOrganism part\n\nConcept: organismpart\nChild of: biologicalspecimen\nPart of an organism, e.g. a tissue sample, plant leaf, flower, bird feather. Include internal parts not composed of organic material (e.g. teeth, bone), and hard body parts that are not shed (hoof, horn, tusk, claw). Hair is tricky, include here for now. Does not necessarily imply existance of parent sample. Not fossilized; generally includes organism parts native to deposits of Holocene to Recent age.\n\nBone object\n\nConcept: peiceofbone\nChild of: organismpart\nSample is an individual bone or part of a bone from an animal.\n\n\n\nOrganism product\n\nConcept: organismproduct\nChild of: biologicalspecimen\nSpecimen is a thing produced by some organism, generally not composed of organic material or including biological tissue, e.g. Shell, antler, egg shell, coral skeleton (organic tissue not included), fecal matter, cocoon, web. Consider internal parts not composed of organic material (e.g. teeth, bone) and hard body parts that are not shed (hoof, horn, tusk) to be organism parts.\n\n\nWhole organism specimen\n\nConcept: wholeorganism\nChild of: biologicalspecimen\nSpecimen consists of the bodies of one or more entire organisms of the same species, from any kingdom. Note that these are also inherently ‘solid object’\n\n\n\nFluid in container\n\nConcept: fluidincontainer\nChild of: physicalspecimen\nSpecimen is a container whose contents are liquid, gas, or mixed dominantly fluid phases, that is the actual sample material. Fluid might include minor solid particles. Container typically human made, but also includes natural fluid container, e.g. fluid inclusion in a mineral grain. Includes colloids, foams, gels, suspensions. The sample is the fluid substance; fluid samples collected to analyze the contained biome should be considered ‘Biome Aggregation’\n\n\nFossil\n\nConcept: fossil\nChild of: physicalspecimen\nSpecimen is the remains of one or more organisms preserved in rock; includes whole body, body parts (usually bone or shell), and trace fossils. An organism or organism part becomes a fossil when it has undergone some fossilization process that generally entails physical and chemical changes akin to diagenesis in a sedimentary rock. Trace fossils are manifestations of biologic activity preserved in a rock body (typically sedimentary), without included preserved body parts.\n\n\nOther solid object\n\nConcept: othersolidobject\nChild of: physicalspecimen\nSingle piece of material not one of the other types, e.g. rock specimen, mineral specimen, core. Ice and permafrost are considered solid materials.\n\n\nResearch product\n\nConcept: researchproduct\nChild of: physicalspecimen\nSpecimen is a product of some research workflow, e.g. a thin section, an XRF pellet, a grain mount, SEM stub, synthetic rock or mineral … In general there should be a link to a parent specimen from which this was derived. Might be aggregation (e.g. a synthetic material powder) or a solid object.\n\nAnalytical preparation\n\nConcept: analyticalpreparation\nChild of: researchproduct\nSpecimen is a product of processing required for some observation procedure, e.g. thin section, XRF bead, SEM stub, rock powder. If identified separately, this should have a ‘parent’ link to the original sample\n\n\nExperiment product\n\nConcept: experimentalproduct\nChild of: researchproduct\nSpecimen is product of an experimental procedure (e.g. synthetic material)"
