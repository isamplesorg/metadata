    "text": "Physical specimen\n\nConcept: physicalspecimen\ntop concept in specimen type hierarchy. Represents any physical specimen.\n\nAny aggregation specimen\n\nConcept: anyaggregation\nChild of: physicalspecimen\nSample consists of a bunch of material fragments, not related to the same object (e.g. not a bunch of broken pot sherds that might be reassembled), but taken together representative of the sampled feature. Examples: loose soil, sediment, crushed rock, particulate, bunches of unrelated pot sherd, human production waste, filtrates and residues. The sample requires some kind of container to keep it together. Cores of loosely consolidated material are considered ‘piece of solid material’ because the internal parts have spatial relationships (e.g. upper part, lower part).\n\nAnthropogenic aggregation\n\nConcept: anthropogenicaggregation\nChild of: anyaggregation\nAggregation consists of fragments of material produced by human activity, not described individually, and generally not all originating from the same object. Includes pottery in an excavation unit that gets an aggregate description, production waste, production raw-materials, or other residues (broken bits of plaster from an destroyed wall), synthetic powders.\n\n\nBiome aggregation sample\n\nConcept: biomeaggregation\nChild of: anyaggregation biologicalspecimen\nSpecimen is an aggregation of whole or fragmentary parts of multiple organisms, microscopic or megascopic, representative of some site.\n\nBundle biome aggregation\n\nConcept: bundlebiomeaggregation\nChild of: biomeaggregation\nAn aggregation of whole organisms representative of some biome\n\n\n\nAggregation\n\nConcept: genericaggregation\nChild of: anyaggregation\nAn aggregate specimen that is not biogenic or composed of anthropogenic material fragments. Examples: loose soil or sediment (e.g. in a bag), rock chips, particulate filtrate or precipitate; rock powders.\n\n\n\nArtifact\n\nConcept: artifact\nChild of: physicalspecimen\nAn object made (manufactured, shaped, modified) by a human being, or precursor hominid. Include a set of pieces belonging originally to a single object and treated as a single specimen.\n\n\nAny biological specimen\n\nConcept: biologicalspecimen\nChild of: physicalspecimen\nSpecimen for which the sampled feature is one or more living organisms from a particular biome context, megascopic or microscopic\n\nBiome aggregation sample\n\nConcept: biomeaggregation\nChild of: anyaggregation biologicalspecimen\nSpecimen is an aggregation of whole or fragmentary parts of multiple organisms, microscopic or megascopic, representative of some site.\n\nBundle biome aggregation\n\nConcept: bundlebiomeaggregation\nChild of: biomeaggregation\nAn aggregation of whole organisms representative of some biome\n\n\n\nOrganism part\n\nConcept: organismpart\nChild of: biologicalspecimen\nPart of an organism, e.g. a tissue sample, plant leaf, flower, bird feather. Include internal parts not composed of organic material (e.g. teeth, bone), and hard body parts that are not shed (hoof, horn, tusk, claw). Hair is tricky, include here for now. Does not necessarily imply existance of parent sample. Not fossilized; generally includes organism parts native to deposits of Holocene to Recent age.\n\n\nOrganism product\n\nConcept: organismproduct\nChild of: biologicalspecimen\nSpecimen is a thing produced by some organism, generally not composed of organic material or including biological tissue, e.g. Shell, antler, egg shell, coral skeleton (organic tissue not included), fecal matter, cocoon, web. Consider internal parts not composed of organic material (e.g. teeth, bone) and hard body parts that are not shed (hoof, horn, tusk) to be organism parts.\n\n\nWhole organism specimen\n\nConcept: wholeorganism\nChild of: biologicalspecimen\nSpecimen consists of the bodies of one or more entire organisms of the same species, from any kingdom. Note that these are also inherently ‘solid object’\n\n\n\nFluid in container\n\nConcept: fluidincontainer\nChild of: physicalspecimen\nSpecimen is a container whose contents are liquid, gas, or mixed dominantly fluid phases, that is the actual sample material. Fluid might include minor solid particles. Container typically human made, but also includes natural fluid container, e.g. fluid inclusion in a mineral grain. Includes colloids, foams, gels, suspensions. The sample is the fluid substance; fluid samples collected to analyze the contained biome should be considered ‘Biome Aggregation’\n\n\nFossil\n\nConcept: fossil\nChild of: physicalspecimen\nSpecimen is the remains of one or more organisms preserved in rock; includes whole body, body parts (usually bone or shell), and trace fossils. An organism or organism part becomes a fossil when it has undergone some fossilization process that generally entails physical and chemical changes akin to diagenesis in a sedimentary rock. Trace fossils are manifestations of biologic activity preserved in a rock body (typically sedimentary), without included preserved body parts.\n\n\nOther solid object\n\nConcept: othersolidobject\nChild of: physicalspecimen\nSingle piece of material not one of the other types, e.g. rock specimen, mineral specimen, core. Ice and permafrost are considered solid materials.\n\n\nResearch product\n\nConcept: researchproduct\nChild of: physicalspecimen\nSpecimen is a product of some research workflow, e.g. a thin section, an XRF pellet, a grain mount, SEM stub, synthetic rock or mineral … In general there should be a link to a parent specimen from which this was derived. Might be aggregation (e.g. a synthetic material powder) or a solid object.\n\nAnalytical preparation\n\nConcept: analyticalpreparation\nChild of: researchproduct\nSpecimen is a product of processing required for some observation procedure, e.g. thin section, XRF bead, SEM stub, rock powder. If identified separately, this should have a ‘parent’ link to the original sample\n\n\nExperiment product\n\nConcept: experimentalproduct\nChild of: researchproduct\nSpecimen is product of an experimental procedure (e.g. synthetic material)"

    "text": "Material\n\nConcept: material\nTop Concept in iSamples Material Category scheme\n\nAny anthropogenic material\n\nConcept: anyanthropogenicmaterial\nChild of: material\nMaterial produced by human activity.\n\nAnthropogenic metal material\n\nConcept: anthropogenicmetal\nChild of: anyanthropogenicmaterial\nSpecimen is dominantly composed of metal that has been produced or used by humans; subclass of anthropogenic material. Samples of naturally occuring metallic material (e.g. native copper, gold nuggets) should be considered mineral material. Metallic material is material that when polished or fractured, shows a lustrous appearance, and conducts electricity and heat relatively well. Metals are typically malleable (they can be hammered into thin sheets) or ductile (can be drawn into wires). The boundaries between metals, nonmetals, and metalloids fluctuate slightly due to a lack of universally accepted definitions of the categories involved. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal). c.f. http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01001069\n\n\nAnthropogenic material\n\nConcept: otheranthropogenicmaterial\nChild of: anyanthropogenicmaterial\nNon-metallic material produced by human activity. Organic products of agricultural activity are both anthropogenic and organic. Include lab preparations like XRF pellet and rock powders. Examples: ceramics, concrete, slag, (anthropogenic) glass, mine tailing, plaster, waste.\n\n\n\nAny ice\n\nConcept: anyice\nChild of: material\na solid material that is normally a liquid or gas at Standard Temperature and Pressre (STP) that is in a solid state under the observed temperature and pressure conditions.\n\nFrozen water\n\nConcept: waterice\nChild of: anyice\nWater that is in a solid state.\n\n\n\nBiogenic non-organic material\n\nConcept: biogenicnonorganicmaterial\nChild of: material\nMaterial produced by an organism but not composed of ‘very large molecules of biological origin.’ E.g. bone, tooth, shell, coral skeleton,\n\n\nDispersed media\n\nConcept: dispersedmedia\nChild of: material\nA material contains discrete elements of one medium that are dispersed in a continuous fluid medium. The dispersed component can be a gas, a liquid or a solid (based on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispersed_media). Does not include mixtures of granular material like soil, sediment, particulate, or solids that would be considered a rock. E.g. aerosol ENVO_00010505, foam ENVO_00005738, emulsion ENVO_00010506, colloidal suspension ENVO_01001560, scum(?)ENVO:00003930, clathrate?\n\n\nNatural Solid Material\n\nConcept: earthmaterial\nChild of: material\nUndifferentiated soil, sediment, rock, or natural particulates. Typically (nessarily?) a granular aggregate that might include any of the previous constiturents. Use for Earth Material aggregates of uncertain origin\n\nMineral\n\nConcept: mineral\nChild of: earthmaterial\nMaterial consists of a single mineral or mineraloid phase. . ‘A mineral is an element or chemical compound that is normally crystalline and that has been formed as a result of geological processes.’ (Nickel, Ernest H. (1995), The definition of a mineral, The Canadian Mineralogist. 33 (3): 689–90). Include mineraloids. … A material primarily composed of some substance that is naturally occurring, solid and stable at room temperature, representable by a chemical formula, usually abiogenic, and that has an ordered atomic structure. (http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01000256). Comment: the identity of a mineral species is defined by a crystal structure and a chemical composition that might include various specific elemental substitutions in that structure. Mineraloid: A naturally occurring mineral-like substance that does not demonstrate crystallinity. Mineraloids possess chemical compositions that vary beyond the generally accepted ranges for specific minerals. Examples: obsidian, Opal. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineraloid)\n\n\nMixed soil sediment or rock\n\nConcept: mixedsoilsedimentrock\nChild of: earthmaterial\nMaterial is mixed aggregation of fragments of undifferentiated soil, sediment or rock origin. e.g. cuttings from some boreholes (rock fragments and caved soil or sediment), sea floor dredge haul (mixed sediment and rock)\n\n\nParticulate\n\nConcept: particulate\nChild of: earthmaterial\nMaterial consists of microscopic particulate material derived by precipitation, filtering, or settling from suspension in a fluid, e.g. filtrate from water, deposition from atmosphere, astro material particles. Might include mineral, organic, or biological material. ENVO definition (ENVO_01000060) has “composed of microscopic portions of solid or liquid material suspended in another environmental material.”, refine here to define as the solid particles, distinct from a material in which they are suspended. A material that includes solid or liquid particles suspended in another material would be a dispersed_media in this scheme, not defined in ENVO. Human manufactured particulates (e.g. rock powder) should be categorized as ‘anthropogenic material’ as well as ‘Particulate’\n\n\nRock or sediment\n\nConcept: rockorsediment\nChild of: earthmaterial\nMaterial is rock or sediment. E.g. for samples from subsurface cores that are not well described, from drill holes that likely penetrate sediment near the surface an might be sampling rock at greater depth.\n\nRock\n\nConcept: rock\nChild of: rockorsediment\nConsolidated aggregate of particles (grains) of rock, mineral (including native elements), mineraloid, or solid organic material. Includes mineral aggregates such as granite, shale, marble; natural glass such as obsidian; organic material formed by geologic processes such a coal; extraterrestrial material in meteorites; and crushed rock fragments like drill cuttings from rock. (based on http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/lithology/rock, same as http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_00001995)\nSee Also:\n\nobo:ENVO_00001995\n<http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/lithology/rock>\n\n\n\nSediment\n\nConcept: sediment\nChild of: rockorsediment\nSolid granular material transported by wind, water, or gravity, not modified by interaction with biosphere or atmosphere (to differentiate from soil). Particles derived by erosion of pre-existing rock, from shell or other body parts from organisms, precipitated chemically in the surficial environment, or generated by explosive volcanic activity. (http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/lithology/sediment). Sediment is not consolidated, i.e. Particulate constituents of a compound material do not adhere to each other strongly enough that the aggregate can be considered a solid material in its own right. Similar to http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_00002007\n\n\n\nSoil\n\nConcept: soil\nChild of: earthmaterial\nMixed granular mineral and organic matter modified by interaction between earth material, biosphere, and atmosphere, consisting mostly of varying proportions of sand, silt, and clay, organic material such as humus, gases, liquids, and a broad range of resident micro- and macroorganisms. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil) Soil consists of horizons near the Earth’s surface that, in contrast to the underlying parent material, have been altered by the interactions of climate, relief, and living organisms over time. (http://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/ portal/nrcs/detail/soils/edu/?cid=nrcs142p2_054280) (http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_00001998)\nSee Also:\n\n<http://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/soils/edu/?cid=nrcs142p2_054280>\n\n\n\n\nFluid material\n\nConcept: fluid\nChild of: material\na substance that continually deforms (flows) under an applied shear stress, or external force. Fluids are a phase of matter and include liquids, gases and plasmas. They are substances with zero shear modulus, or, in simpler terms, substances that cannot resist any shear force applied to them. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid)\n\nGaseous material\n\nConcept: gas\nChild of: fluid\nMaterial composed of one or more chemical entities that has neither independent shape nor volume but tends to expand indefinitely (http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01000797). Infer that the sample is curated in some kind of container.\n\n\nLiquid water\n\nConcept: liquidwater\nChild of: fluid\nA material primarily composed of dihydrogen oxide in its liquid form; infer that the sample is curated in some kind of container.\n\n\nNon-aqueous liquid material\n\nConcept: nonaqueousliquid\nChild of: fluid\nLiquid composed dominantly of material other than water. Includes liquids that do not fit in any other category. E.g. alcohol, petroleum.\n\n\n\nOrganic material\n\nConcept: organicmaterial\nChild of: material\nEnvironmental material derived from living organisms and composed primarily of one or more very large molecules of biological origin. Examples: body (animal or plant), body part, fecal matter, seeds, wood, tissue, biological fluids, biological waste, algal material, biofilm, necromass, plankton. source: http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01000155"
