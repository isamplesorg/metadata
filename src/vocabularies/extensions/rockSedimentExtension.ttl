In sedimentary environments, breccia is used for material that consists entirely of angular fragments, mostly derived from a single source rock body, as in a rock avalanche deposit, and matrix is interpreted to be the product of comminution of clasts during transport. Diamictite or diamicton is used when the material reflects mixing of rock from a variety of sources, some sub angular or subrounded clasts may be present, and matrix is pre-existing fine grained material that is not a direct product of the brecciation/deposition process."@en ;

In practice the use of clastic mudstone terminology as opposed to carbonate mudstone terminology may be dermined by a priori knowledge about the rock being categorized. If it is associated with other clastic rocks, the clastic categories will be favored, if with cabonate rocks, the carbonate categories will be favored. Carbonate rock subcatgories are defined on two orthogonal dimensions--mineralogy (calcitic vs. dolomitic vs non-carbonate impurities), and texture. The texture categories used here are those of Dunham (1962), and involve grain size (matrix vs. grains/allochems), fabric (matrix vs. grain supported), and genesis (bound, frame, or fragmental). The textural approach used for carbonate rocks is conceptually incompatible with that used for clastic sedimentary rocks, which is solely grain size or mineralogy based. This leads to problems in the vocabulary for rocks of mixed siliclastic/carbonate mineralogy (grainstone vs. sandstone, carbonate mudstone vs. carbonate rich mudstone, how to accomodate marlstone...)."@en ;

Siliciclastic is considered too limiting because the category includes rocks that consists clasts of carbonate minerals, e.g. epiclastic detritus eroded from carbonate rock. Terrigineous clastic was considered and rejected first because it is considered redundant, anything that is terrigineous is clastic. Second, it is questionable if clastic sediment derived by submarine processes (fragementation by gravity sliding, faulting, or volcanic activity, with transport by sediment gravity flow or submarine currents) is terrigineous, but it is clastic and is meant to be included in this category."@en ;

  rdfs:comment "The conglomerate, sandstone, mudstone, and wackestone categories are not defined as kinds of clastic sedimentary rocks because rocks meeting their purely grainsize based definitions might also be iron-rich, phosphatic, or carbonate. This is based on GeoSciML allowance to assign rocks to more than one lithology category. For example to categorize a rock as a clastic conglomerate requires assignment ot the 'clastic sedimentary rock' category and to the 'conglomerate' category. Particularly for fine-grained sedimentary rocks, distinction of 'intrabasinal' versus 'clastic' genesis can be very interpretive. In practice the use of clastic mudstone terminology as opposed to carbonate mudstone terminology may be dermined by a priori knowledge about the rock being categorized.

For example changes take place in organic materials at lower temperatures than in rocks dominated by silicate minerals. In mudrocks, a white mica (illite) crystallinity value of less than 0.42 Delta 2 Theta obtained by X-ray diffraction analysis, is used to define the onset of metamorphism (Kisch, 1991). In this scheme, the first appearance of glaucophane, lawsonite, paragonite, prehnite, pumpellyite or stilpnomelane is taken to indicate the lower limit of metamorphism (Frey and Kisch, 1987; Bucher and Frey, 1994; Frey and Robinson, 1998). Most workers agree that such mineral growth starts at 150 +/- 50° C in silicate rocks. Many lithologies may show no change in mineralogy under these conditions and hence the recognition of the onset of metamorphism will vary with bulk composition.”"@en ;

  rdfs:comment "In practice, it is likely that any rock for which there is suspicion that it may consist of redeposited pyroclastic material, usually based on sedimentary structures, irrespective of the presence or percentage of clearly epiclastic particles, would be called a tuffite. 50 percent cutoff with epiclastic rock is in contrast with LeMaitre et al., but is used for consistentency with other sedimentary rock categories following the pattern that the rock name reflects the predominant constituent."@en ;

  rdfs:comment "Rock and sediment categories for iSamples materialType classification. Remove anthropogenic materials and classes for consolidated or non-consolidated material; remove leaf classes subjectively based on abundance of material type and number of subclasses. There are 83 'mat:rock' subclasses; these include some classes that are non-consolidated material (e.g. fault gouge) but these are not sediment and adding 'material' classes that are independent of consolidation seems like more overhead than needed. Note that a given material is likely to fit in more that one class; for example the sediment subclasses include compositional classes (e.g. carbonate, clastic) as well as grain size classes (gravel-size sediment). A calcareous ooze sample would be both 'mud-size sediment' and 'carbonate sediment'.   Change owl:class to skos:concept, and rdfs:subClassOf to skos:broader."@en ;
