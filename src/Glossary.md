|**Peel**|  Acetate peels are replicas of etched surfaces embedded in sheets of cellulose acetate. These replicas are usually so detailed that the fine structure of shells and various sedimentary rocks can be easily studied under a light microscope. Because these peels can be quickly and easily produced, the procedure is now commonly used in most geologic laboratories. |  Wilson and Palmer, 1988, doi: 10.1017/S2475262200005074 |
