        permissible_values:
            Any anthropogenic material:
                description: Material produced by human activity. Intention is for materials that would not be found in nature without human intervention. Thus clay would be a 'Mineral' material, but fired clay in a brick or ceramic would be an 'Anthropogenic material'.   Native copper would be a Mineral, but smelted copper, extracted from ore that might include native copper (among other sulfide and oxide minerals) would be 'Anthropogenic metal material'. This is a general class for undifferentiated metal or non-metal anthropogenic material.

            Anthropogenic material:
                description: Non-metallic material produced by human activity. Organic products of agricultural activity are both anthropogenic and organic. Include lab preparations like XRF pellet and rock powders. Examples-- ceramics, brick, concrete, slag, (anthropogenic) glass, mine tailing, plaster, waste.

            Anthropogenic metal material:
                description: Specimen is dominantly composed of metal that has been produced or used by humans; subclass of anthropogenic material. Samples of naturally occuring metallic material (e.g. native copper, gold nuggets) should be considered mineral material. Metallic material is material that when polished or fractured, shows a lustrous appearance, and conducts electricity and heat relatively well. Metals are typically malleable (they can be hammered into thin sheets) or ductile (can be drawn into wires). The boundaries between metals, nonmetals, and metalloids fluctuate slightly due to a lack of universally accepted definitions of the categories involved.

                description: a solid material that is normally a liquid or gas at Standard Temperature and Pressre (STP)  that is in a solid state under the observed temperature and pressure conditions. Samples of non-aqueous ice should be classified as 'Any ice'. This is considered enough of an edge case that distinguishing 'ice that might or might not be aqueous' from 'non-aqueous ice' does not merit adding another class to the scheme.

                description: a substance that continually deforms (flows) under an applied shear stress, or external force. Fluids are a phase of matter and include liquids, gases and plasmas. They are substances with zero shear modulus, or, in simpler terms, substances that cannot resist any shear force applied to them.

            Mineral:
                description: Material consists of a single mineral or mineraloid phase. 'A mineral is an element or chemical compound that is normally crystalline and that has been formed as a result of geological processes.' (Nickel, Ernest H. (1995), The definition of a mineral, The Canadian Mineralogist. 33(3):689â€“90). Include mineraloids. ... A material primarily composed of some substance that is naturally occurring, solid and stable at room temperature, representable by a chemical formula, usually abiogenic, and that has an ordered atomic structure. The identity of a mineral species is defined by a crystal structure and a chemical composition that might include various specific elemental substitutions in that structure. Mineraloid--A naturally occurring mineral-like substance that does not demonstrate crystallinity. Mineraloids (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineraloid) possess chemical compositions that vary beyond the generally accepted ranges for specific minerals. Examples-obsidian, Opal.

            Natural Solid Material:
                description: Undifferentiated, mineral, soil, sediment, rock, or natural particulates. Typically (nessarily?) a granular aggregate that might include any of the previous constiturents. Use for Earth Material aggregates of uncertain origin

                description: Liquid composed dominantly of material other than water. Includes liquids that do not fit in any other category. E.g. alcohol, petroleum. Fluids like blood, urine, mucus are problematic. Suggest categorizing as 'Non-aqueous liquid material' and 'Organic material' or 'Biogenic non-organic material'.

                description: use for missing values, explicit null. This is not a term from the iSamples materials vocabulary, but included for software implementation.
            Organic material:
                description: Environmental material derived from living organisms and composed primarily of one or more very large molecules of biological origin. Examples--body (animal or plant), body part, fecal matter, seeds, wood, tissue, biological fluids, biological waste, algal material, biofilm, necromass, plankton.  Distinction from 'Biogenic non-organic material' is fuzzy. Biogenic non-organic material is intended to cover biogenic products consisting of mineral or mineraloid substance, e.g. apatite (or other Ca phosphates), aragonite (or other Ca carbonate) typical of shells, bone, teeth. Also note potential overlap with organic compounds that occur as naturally formed minerals ('Organic mineral', in geo materials mineral group extension vocabulary).

            Particulate:
                description: Material consists of microscopic particulate material derived by precipitation, filtering, or settling from suspension in a fluid, e.g. filtrate from water, deposition from atmosphere, astro material particles. Might include mineral, organic, or biological material. ENVO definition (ENVO_01000060) has \"composed of microscopic portions of solid or liquid material suspended in another environmental material.\", refine here to define as the solid particles, distinct from a material in which they are suspended. A material that includes solid or liquid particles suspended in another material would be a dispersed_media in this scheme, not defined in ENVO. Human manufactured particulates (e.g. rock powder) should be categorized as 'anthropogenic material' as well as 'Particulate'

            Rock or sediment:
                description: Material is rock or sediment.  E.g. for samples from subsurface cores that are not well described, from drill holes that likely penetrate sediment near the surface an might be sampling rock at greater depth, or sea floor dredge haul consisting of mixed sediment and rock. Distinct from 'Mixed soil, sediment or rock' that represents samples known to have components of all these materials.

            Sediment:
                description: Solid granular material transported by wind, water, or gravity, not modified by interaction with biosphere or atmosphere (to differentiate from soil). Particles derived by erosion of pre-existing rock, from shell or other body parts from organisms, or precipitated chemically in the surficial environment (http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/lithology/sediment). Sediment is not consolidated, i.e. Particulate constituents of a compound material do not adhere to each other strongly enough that the aggregate can be considered a solid material in its own right. NOTE that some chemical sediments crystallize directly as solid material or aggregates when deposited, but are considered sediment because of their origin.

Examples--loose soil, sediment, crushed rock,  particulate, bunches of unrelated pot sherd, human production waste, filtrates and residues.

An organism or organism part becomes a fossil when it has undergone some fossilization process that generally entails physical and chemical changes akin to diagenesis in a sedimentary rock. Trace fossils are manifestations of biologic activity preserved in a rock body (typically sedimentary), without included preserved body parts.  There are many processes that lead to fossilization, including permineralization, casts and molds, authigenic mineralization, replacement and recrystallization, adpression, carbonization, and bioimmuration.
