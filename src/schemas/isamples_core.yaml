title: Schema for documenting physical samples
description: Startup schema for iSamples sample registry integration. updated from 0.2 by synchronizing the vocabulary enumerations, change 'id' to '@id' and 'schema' to '$schema'.  Schema name is iSamplesSchemaBasic0.2.1.json. Target JSON schema version is http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema# SMR 2022-10-07. SMR 2023-03-17. Move authorized_by into SamplingEvent, change keywords to list of Keyword objects with string, uri, scheme and scheme URI. Reorder elements in slot list.  Update scheme URI to 1.0.

    PhysicalSampleRecord:
        description: This is a data object that is a digital representation of a physical
            sample, and thus shares the same identifier as the physical object. It
            provides descriptive properties for any iSamples physical sample, URI
            for the metadata record is same as URI for physical sample-- digital object
            is considered twin of physical object, a representation. IGSN is recommended.
            Must be a URI that can be dereferenced on the web.
