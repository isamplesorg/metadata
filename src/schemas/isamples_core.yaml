  SMR 2022-10-07. Schema for iSamples sample registry integration. Updated from 0.2 by synchronizing the vocabulary enumerations, change
  'id' to '@id' and 'schema' to '$schema'.  Schema name is iSamplesSchemaCore1.0.json. Target JSON schema version is
  https://json-schema.org/draft/2019-09/schema.  SMR 2023-03-17. Move authorized_by into SamplingEvent, change
  keywords to list of Keyword objects with string, uri, scheme and scheme URI. Reorder elements in slot list. Update
  scheme URI to 1.0 2023-06-13 SMR add project property on SamplingEvent, with text or URI value. 2024-01-17 SMR run
  linkml-lint from current linkml version before rebuilding JSON schema.  2024-04-19. DV ran yaml linter on the file to clean 
  up formatting, put hard return in text bodies.  Update schema URI to dereference with w3id. SMR 2024-09-13 add last_modified_time
  as property of MaterialSampleRecord.

  MaterialSampleRecord:
    description: >
      This is a data object that is a digital representation of a material sample, and thus shares the same
      identifier as the physical object. It provides descriptive properties for any iSamples material sample, URI for
      the metadata record is same as URI for material sample-- digital object is considered twin of physical object, a
      representation. IGSN is recommended. Must be a URI that can be dereferenced on the web.
