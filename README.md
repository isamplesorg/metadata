## Run tools in a Docker container
The iSamples Metadata Docker container is based on the Docker container from the LinkML project [https://hub.docker.com/r/monarchinitiative/linkml/tags]

First you'll build the image:
`docker build -t isamples_linkml .`

Then running it will open a bash shell:
`docker run -a stdin -a stdout -i -t isamples_linkml`

Then use the following commands to generate LinkML:
* Command 1
* Command 2
* Command 3
