Intention is for materials that would not be found in nature without human intervention. Thus clay would be a 'Mineral' material, but fired clay in a brick or ceramic would be an 'Anthropogenic material'. Native copper would be a Mineral, but smelted copper, extracted from ore that might include native copper (among other sulfide and oxide minerals) would be 'Anthropogenic metal material'.

Organic products of agricultural activity are both anthropogenic and organic. Include lab preparations like XRF pellet and rock powders. Examples-- ceramics, brick, concrete, slag, (anthropogenic) glass, mine tailing, plaster, waste. mat:otheranthropogenicmaterial {'from_schema': 'https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/0.9/materialsvocabulary'} Anthropogenic metal material Specimen is dominantly composed of metal that has been produced or used by humans; subclass of anthropogenic material. Samples of naturally occuring metallic material (e.g. native copper, gold nuggets) should be considered mineral material. Metallic material is material that when polished or fractured, shows a lustrous appearance, and conducts electricity and heat relatively well. Metals are typically malleable (they can be hammered into thin sheets) or ductile (can be drawn into wires). The boundaries between metals, nonmetals, and metalloids fluctuate slightly due to a lack of universally accepted definitions of the categories involved. mat:anthropogenicmetal {'from_schema': 'https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/0.9/materialsvocabulary', 'see_also': ['http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01001069']} Any Ice a solid material that is normally a liquid or gas at Standard Temperature and Pressre (STP) that is in a solid state under the observed temperature and pressure conditions.

A material primarily composed of some substance that is naturally occurring, solid and stable at room temperature, representable by a chemical formula, usually abiogenic, and that has an ordered atomic structure. The identity of a mineral species is defined by a crystal structure and a chemical composition that might include various specific elemental substitutions in that structure. Mineraloid--A naturally occurring mineral-like substance that does not demonstrate crystallinity. Mineraloids (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineraloid) possess chemical compositions that vary beyond the generally accepted ranges for specific minerals.

Examples--body (animal or plant), body part, fecal matter, seeds, wood, tissue, biological fluids, biological waste, algal material, biofilm, necromass, plankton. Distinction from 'Biogenic non-organic material' is fuzzy. Biogenic non-organic material is intended to cover biogenic products consisting of mineral or mineraloid substance, e.g. apatite (or other Ca phosphates), aragonite (or other Ca carbonate) typical of shells, bone, teeth. Also note potential overlap with organic compounds that occur as naturally formed minerals ('Organic mineral', in geo materials mineral group extension vocabulary). mat:organicmaterial {'from_schema': 'https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/0.9/materialsvocabulary', 'see_also': ['http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01000155']} Particulate Material consists of microscopic particulate material derived by precipitation, filtering, or settling from suspension in a fluid, e.g. filtrate from water, deposition from atmosphere, astro material particles.

ENVO definition (ENVO_01000060) has \\\"composed of microscopic portions of solid or liquid material suspended in another environmental material.\\\", refine here to define as the solid particles, distinct from a material in which they are suspended.

Particles derived by erosion of pre-existing rock, from shell or other body parts from organisms, or precipitated chemically in the surficial environment (http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/lithology/sediment). Sediment is not consolidated, i.e. Particulate constituents of a compound material do not adhere to each other strongly enough that the aggregate can be considered a solid material in its own right.

Intention is for materials that would not be found in nature without human intervention.

Samples of naturally occuring metallic material (e.g. native copper, gold nuggets) should be considered mineral material. Metallic material is material that when polished or fractured, shows a lustrous appearance, and conducts electricity and heat relatively well. Metals are typically malleable (they can be hammered into thin sheets) or ductile (can be drawn into wires). The boundaries between metals, nonmetals, and metalloids fluctuate slightly due to a lack of universally accepted definitions of the categories involved. mat:anthropogenicmetal {'from_schema': 'https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/0.9/materialsvocabulary', 'see_also': ['http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01001069']} Any Ice a solid material that is normally a liquid or gas at Standard Temperature and Pressre (STP) that is in a solid state under the observed temperature and pressure conditions.

A material primarily composed of some substance that is naturally occurring, solid and stable at room temperature, representable by a chemical formula, usually abiogenic, and that has an ordered atomic structure. The identity of a mineral species is defined by a crystal structure and a chemical composition that might include various specific elemental substitutions in that structure.

An organism or organism part becomes a fossil when it has undergone some fossilization process that generally entails physical and chemical changes akin to diagenesis in a sedimentary rock. Trace fossils are manifestations of biologic activity preserved in a rock body (typically sedimentary), without included preserved body parts. There are many processes that lead to fossilization, including permineralization, casts and molds, authigenic mineralization, replacement and recrystallization, adpression, carbonization, and bioimmuration. spec:fossil {'from_schema': 'https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/specimentype/0.9/specimentypevocabulary', 'see_also': ['http://sweet.jpl.nasa.gov/2.3/matrRock.owl#Fossil', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil']} Fluid in container Specimen is a container whose contents are liquid, gas, or mixed dominantly fluid phases, that is the actual sample material. Fluid might include minor solid particles. Container typically human made, but also includes natural fluid container, e.g. fluid inclusion in a mineral grain.

Examples--loose soil, sediment, crushed rock, particulate, bunches of unrelated pot sherd, human production waste, filtrates and residues.
