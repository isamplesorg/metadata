Intention is for materials that would not be found in nature without human intervention. Thus clay would be a 'Mineral' material, but fired clay in a brick or ceramic would be an 'Anthropogenic material'. Native copper would be a Mineral, but smelted copper, extracted from ore that might include native copper (among other sulfide and oxide minerals) would be 'Anthropogenic metal material'. This is a general class for undifferentiated metal or non-metal anthropogenic material. mat:anyanthropogenicmaterial {'from_schema': 'https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/0.9/materialsvocabulary', 'see_also': ['http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_0010001']} Anthropogenic material Non-metallic material produced by human activity. Organic products of agricultural activity are both anthropogenic and organic. Include lab preparations like XRF pellet and rock powders. Examples-- ceramics, brick, concrete, slag, (anthropogenic) glass, mine tailing, plaster, waste. mat:otheranthropogenicmaterial {'from_schema': 'https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/0.9/materialsvocabulary'} Anthropogenic metal material Specimen is dominantly composed of metal that has been produced or used by humans; subclass of anthropogenic material. Samples of naturally occuring metallic material (e.g. native copper, gold nuggets) should be considered mineral material. Metallic material is material that when polished or fractured, shows a lustrous appearance, and conducts electricity and heat relatively well. Metals are typically malleable (they can be hammered into thin sheets) or ductile (can be drawn into wires). The boundaries between metals, nonmetals, and metalloids fluctuate slightly due to a lack of universally accepted definitions of the categories involved. mat:anthropogenicmetal {'from_schema': 'https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/0.9/materialsvocabulary', 'see_also': ['http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01001069']} Any Ice a solid material that is normally a liquid or gas at Standard Temperature and Pressre (STP) that is in a solid state under the observed temperature and pressure conditions. Samples of non-aqueous ice should be classified as 'Any ice'. This is considered enough of an edge case that distinguishing 'ice that might or might not be aqueous' from 'non-aqueous ice' does not merit adding another class to the scheme. mat:anyice {'from_schema': 'https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/0.9/materialsvocabulary', 'see_also': ['http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01001125']} Biogenic non-organic material Material produced by an organism but not composed of 'very large molecules of biological origin.'

'A mineral is an element or chemical compound that is normally crystalline and that has been formed as a result of geological processes.' (Nickel, Ernest H. (1995), The definition of a mineral, The Canadian Mineralogist. 33 (3): 689\u201390). Include mineraloids. ... A material primarily composed of some substance that is naturally occurring, solid and stable at room temperature, representable by a chemical formula, usually abiogenic, and that has an ordered atomic structure. (http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01000256). Comment: the identity of a mineral species is defined by a crystal structure and a chemical composition that might include various specific elemental substitutions in that structure. Mineraloid: A naturally occurring mineral-like substance that does not demonstrate crystallinity. Mineraloids possess chemical compositions that vary beyond the generally accepted ranges for specific minerals. Examples: obsidian, Opal.

Might include mineral, organic, or biological material. ENVO definition (ENVO_01000060) has \"composed of microscopic portions of solid or liquid material suspended in another environmental material.\", refine here to define as the solid particles, distinct from a material in which they are suspended. A material that includes solid or liquid particles suspended in another material would be a dispersed_media in this scheme, not defined in ENVO.
