| :--- | :---: | :---: | ---: |
| Any anthropogenic material | Material produced by human activity. Intention is for materials that would not be found in nature without human intervention. Thus clay would be a 'Mineral' material, but fired clay in a brick or ceramic would be an 'Anthropogenic material'.   Native copper would be a Mineral, but smelted copper, extracted from ore that might include native copper (among other sulfide and oxide minerals) would be 'Anthropogenic metal material'. This is a general class for undifferentiated metal or non-metal anthropogenic material. | mat:anyanthropogenicmaterial | {'from_schema': 'https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/0.9/materialsvocabulary', 'see_also': ['http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_0010001']} |
| Anthropogenic material | Non-metallic material produced by human activity. Organic products of agricultural activity are both anthropogenic and organic. Include lab preparations like XRF pellet and rock powders. Examples-- ceramics, brick, concrete, slag, (anthropogenic) glass, mine tailing, plaster, waste. | mat:otheranthropogenicmaterial | {'from_schema': 'https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/0.9/materialsvocabulary'} |
| Anthropogenic metal material | Specimen is dominantly composed of metal that has been produced or used by humans; subclass of anthropogenic material. Samples of naturally occuring metallic material (e.g. native copper, gold nuggets) should be considered mineral material. Metallic material is material that when polished or fractured, shows a lustrous appearance, and conducts electricity and heat relatively well. Metals are typically malleable (they can be hammered into thin sheets) or ductile (can be drawn into wires). The boundaries between metals, nonmetals, and metalloids fluctuate slightly due to a lack of universally accepted definitions of the categories involved. | mat:anthropogenicmetal | {'from_schema': 'https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/0.9/materialsvocabulary', 'see_also': ['http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01001069']} |
| Any Ice | a solid material that is normally a liquid or gas at Standard Temperature and Pressre (STP)  that is in a solid state under the observed temperature and pressure conditions. Samples of non-aqueous ice should be classified as 'Any ice'. This is considered enough of an edge case that distinguishing 'ice that might or might not be aqueous' from 'non-aqueous ice' does not merit adding another class to the scheme. | mat:anyice | {'from_schema': 'https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/0.9/materialsvocabulary', 'see_also': ['http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01001125']} |
| Biogenic non-organic material | Material produced by an organism but not composed of 'very large molecules of biological origin.' E.g. bone, tooth, shell, coral skeleton | mat:biogenicnonorganicmaterial | {'from_schema': 'https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/0.9/materialsvocabulary', 'see_also': ['http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CHEBI_64389', 'http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01001644', 'http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0002481']} |
| Dispersed media | A material contains discrete elements of one medium that are dispersed in a continuous fluid medium.  The dispersed component can be a gas, a liquid or a solid (based on https //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispersed_media). Does not include mixtures of granular material like soil, sediment, particulate, or solids that would be considered a rock. E.g. aerosol ENVO_00010505, foam ENVO_00005738, emulsion ENVO_00010506, colloidal suspension ENVO_01001560, scum(?)ENVO:00003930, clathrate? | mat:dispersedmedia | {'from_schema': 'https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/0.9/materialsvocabulary', 'see_also': ['http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_00010506', 'http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01001560', 'https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q181780']} |
| Fluid material | a substance that continually deforms (flows) under an applied shear stress, or external force. Fluids are a phase of matter and include liquids, gases and plasmas. They are substances with zero shear modulus, or, in simpler terms, substances that cannot resist any shear force applied to them. | mat:fluid | {'from_schema': 'https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/0.9/materialsvocabulary', 'see_also': ['http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_02000140', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid']} |
| Gaseous material | Material composed of one or more chemical entities that has neither independent shape nor volume but tends to expand indefinitely | mat:gas | {'from_schema': 'https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/0.9/materialsvocabulary', 'see_also': ['http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01000797']} |
| Frozen water | Water that is in a solid state. | mat:waterice | {'from_schema': 'https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/0.9/materialsvocabulary', 'see_also': ['http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01000277']} |
| Liquid water | A material primarily composed of dihydrogen oxide in its liquid form; infer that the sample is curated in some kind of container. | mat:liquidwater | {'from_schema': 'https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/0.9/materialsvocabulary', 'see_also': ['http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_00002006']} |
| Material | Any material. Top Concept in iSamples Material Category scheme | mat:material | {'from_schema': 'https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/0.9/materialsvocabulary', 'see_also': ['http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_00010483', 'https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q214609']} |
| Mineral | Material consists of a single mineral or mineraloid phase. 'A mineral is an element or chemical compound that is normally crystalline and that has been formed as a result of geological processes.' (Nickel, Ernest H. (1995), The definition of a mineral, The Canadian Mineralogist. 33(3):689â€“90). Include mineraloids. ... A material primarily composed of some substance that is naturally occurring, solid and stable at room temperature, representable by a chemical formula, usually abiogenic, and that has an ordered atomic structure. The identity of a mineral species is defined by a crystal structure and a chemical composition that might include various specific elemental substitutions in that structure. Mineraloid--A naturally occurring mineral-like substance that does not demonstrate crystallinity. Mineraloids (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineraloid) possess chemical compositions that vary beyond the generally accepted ranges for specific minerals. Examples-obsidian, Opal. | mat:mineral | {'from_schema': 'https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/0.9/materialsvocabulary', 'see_also': ['http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01000256']} |
| Mixed soil sediment or rock | Material is mixed aggregation of fragments of undifferentiated soil, sediment or  rock origin. e.g. cuttings from some boreholes (rock fragments and caved soil or sediment). This class is for samples that are solid Earth materials but known not to be mineral or particulate samples. This class is for samples that are solid Earth materials but known not to be mineral or particulate samples. | mat:mixedsoilsedimentrock | {'from_schema': 'https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/0.9/materialsvocabulary'} |
| Natural Solid Material | Undifferentiated, mineral, soil, sediment, rock, or natural particulates. Typically (nessarily?) a granular aggregate that might include any of the previous constiturents. Use for Earth Material aggregates of uncertain origin | mat:earthmaterial | {'from_schema': 'https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/0.9/materialsvocabulary', 'see_also': ['http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/lithology/compound_material', 'https://w3id.org/gso/geology/Solid_Geologic_Material']} |
| Non-aqueous liquid material | Liquid composed dominantly of material other than water. Includes liquids that do not fit in any other category. E.g. alcohol, petroleum. Fluids like blood, urine, mucus are problematic. Suggest categorizing as 'Non-aqueous liquid material' and 'Organic material' or 'Biogenic non-organic material'. | mat:nonaqueousliquid | {'from_schema': 'https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/0.9/materialsvocabulary', 'see_also': ['http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/PDQ/CDR0000446576', 'http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_00002984']} |
| Not Provided | use for missing values, explicit null. This is not a term from the iSamples materials vocabulary, but included for software implementation. |  |  |
| Organic material | Environmental material derived from living organisms and composed primarily of one or more very large molecules of biological origin. Examples--body (animal or plant), body part, fecal matter, seeds, wood, tissue, biological fluids, biological waste, algal material, biofilm, necromass, plankton.  Distinction from 'Biogenic non-organic material' is fuzzy. Biogenic non-organic material is intended to cover biogenic products consisting of mineral or mineraloid substance, e.g. apatite (or other Ca phosphates), aragonite (or other Ca carbonate) typical of shells, bone, teeth. Also note potential overlap with organic compounds that occur as naturally formed minerals ('Organic mineral', in geo materials mineral group extension vocabulary). | mat:organicmaterial | {'from_schema': 'https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/0.9/materialsvocabulary', 'see_also': ['http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01000155']} |
| Particulate | Material consists of microscopic particulate material derived by precipitation, filtering, or settling from suspension in a fluid, e.g. filtrate from water, deposition from atmosphere, astro material particles. Might include mineral, organic, or biological material. ENVO definition (ENVO_01000060) has \"composed of microscopic portions of solid or liquid material suspended in another environmental material.\", refine here to define as the solid particles, distinct from a material in which they are suspended. A material that includes solid or liquid particles suspended in another material would be a dispersed_media in this scheme, not defined in ENVO. Human manufactured particulates (e.g. rock powder) should be categorized as 'anthropogenic material' as well as 'Particulate' | mat:particulate | {'from_schema': 'https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/0.9/materialsvocabulary', 'see_also': ['http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/MESH/D052638', 'http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCIT_C1709', 'http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01000060']} |
| Rock or sediment | Material is rock or sediment.  E.g. for samples from subsurface cores that are not well described, from drill holes that likely penetrate sediment near the surface an might be sampling rock at greater depth, or sea floor dredge haul consisting of mixed sediment and rock. Distinct from 'Mixed soil, sediment or rock' that represents samples known to have components of all these materials. | mat:rockorsediment | {'from_schema': 'https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/0.9/materialsvocabulary'} |
| Rock | Consolidated aggregate of particles (grains) of rock, mineral (including native elements), mineraloid, or solid organic material. Includes mineral aggregates such as granite, shale, marble; natural glass such as obsidian; organic material formed by geologic processes such a coal;  extraterrestrial material in meteorites; and  crushed rock fragments like drill cuttings from rock. | mat:rock | {'from_schema': 'https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/0.9/materialsvocabulary', 'see_also': ['http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/lithology/rock', 'http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_00001995']} |
| Sediment | Solid granular material transported by wind, water, or gravity, not modified by interaction with biosphere or atmosphere (to differentiate from soil). Particles derived by erosion of pre-existing rock, from shell or other body parts from organisms, or precipitated chemically in the surficial environment (http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/lithology/sediment). Sediment is not consolidated, i.e. Particulate constituents of a compound material do not adhere to each other strongly enough that the aggregate can be considered a solid material in its own right. NOTE that some chemical sediments crystallize directly as solid material or aggregates when deposited, but are considered sediment because of their origin. | mat:sediment | {'from_schema': 'https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/0.9/materialsvocabulary', 'see_also': ['http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_00002007', 'http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/lithology/sediment']} |
| Soil | Mixed granular mineral and organic matter modified by interaction between earth material, biosphere, and atmosphere, consisting mostly of varying proportions of sand, silt, and clay, organic material such as humus, gases, liquids, and a broad range of resident micro- and macroorganisms. Soil consists of horizons near the Earth's surface that, in contrast to the underlying parent material, have been altered by the interactions of climate, relief, and living organisms over time. | mat:soil | {'from_schema': 'https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/0.9/materialsvocabulary', 'see_also': ['https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil', 'http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_00001998', 'http://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/soils/edu/?cid=nrcs142p2_054280']} |
